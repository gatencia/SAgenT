The pieces must be arranged to form a single closed loop (a fence) where every piece touches its neighbors edge-to-edge. The fence must enclose a single contiguous region of empty area. The goal is to maximize area, but for this decision problem, you must construct a fence that encloses an area of AT LEAST 60 unit squares.",
