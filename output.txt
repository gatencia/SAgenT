The problem is UNSAT. The board is 8x8 with 2 blocked cells (0,0) and (7,7), resulting in an available area of 8*8 - 2 = 62 cells. There are 12 free pentominoes, each covering 5 cells. The total area covered by all 12 pentominoes is 12 * 5 = 60 cells. Since the available area (62) does not match the required covered area (60), it is impossible to tile the board using all pentominoes exactly once. Therefore, no solution exists.
